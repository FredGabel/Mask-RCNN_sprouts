# Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation

This is an implementation of [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.
All these files need to be inside a folder "Mask_RCNN-master"
Add the files to be trained in in a folder 'class_name' with annots folder and images folder
Add the new_image folder to test new images
